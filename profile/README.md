## Goodbye

Time to Say Goodbye â€“ Thank You All

With reflection and gratitude, I've decided to bring the Infinity Mods (previously known as BigWorldProject) GitHub organization to a close. It's been an incredible journey - one filled with creativity, learning, and the joy of building something alongside so many passionate people.

I truly believe it's better to step away in strength than to let things slowly wither. Rather than watch the project fade into inactivity, I've chosen to close this chapter on a high note - while it still means something to me, and hopefully to you too.

To everyone who contributed, thank you. Whether you wrote code, opened issues, shared feedback, or simply showed interest, your involvement made a real difference. The organisation wouldn't have existed without your time, energy, and ideas.

While the organization is coming to an end, I hope the spirit behind it lives on - in the same projects but a different home, in lessons learned, or maybe just in good memories.

agb1, Lollorian, Magus, White Agnus, thank you for being a part of this.
